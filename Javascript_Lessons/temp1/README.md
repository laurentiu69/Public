 My Public way into Visual Foxpro 9.0 SP2:
 <li>Search for ISO and 2 service packs on internet but check the SHA1 hash to be equal with those at https://msdn.lol-inter.net/families/90
 <li>Task Pane Manager requires MSXML 4.0 to be installed.
     Download and install from https://www.microsoft.com:443/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=7F6C0CB4-7A5E-4790-A7CF-9E139E6819C0&displaylang=en
 <li>Dezactivate Task Pane Manager autostart - that's why VFP start slow - the old sites are'nt anymore .
